              When Hitler came to power in 1933, British leaders worried that 
              a new war might begin. By 1934, afraid that British cities and towns 
              would be targets for bombing raids by aircraft, officials made secret 
              plans to move infants, schoolchildren and some adults to the countryside 
              if war began.</p>
            <p> In 1938, during the Munich crisis, evacuation was very nearly 
              started in Britain, but war was avoided and children remained at 
              home. More detailed evacuation plans were prepared after the crisis. 
              Evacuation was to be voluntary, with parents deciding whether to 
              send their children away.</p>
            <p>A year later, in September 1939, evacuation commenced several days 
              before Britain entered the war. From the cities and big towns, schoolchildren, 
              their teachers, mothers with children under five, pregnant women, 
              and some disabled people were moved by train and road to smaller 
              towns and villages in the countryside. The evacuation plan worked 
              very well and 1½ million children and adults were moved within 3 
              days, including 600,000 from London. The government was disappointed 
              because it had hoped to evacuate 3 million people. More than half 
              of all schoolchildren did not leave their homes in the cities and 
              towns.</p>
            <p>There were no big bombing raids on Britain in the first months 
              of the war and, by early 1940, many children had returned home. 
            </p>
            <p>In June 1940, following the defeat of France, people were afraid 
              that towns on the east and southeast coasts of England would be 
              bombed, and there was a large evacuation of children from these 
              towns to safer areas.</p>
            <p>When heavy bombing raids started in the autumn of 1940 - the Blitz 
              - another big evacuation began.</p>

            Later, in 1944, when Germany attacked Britain with flying bombs and 
            rockets, and places like London were badly damaged again, a further 
            large evacuation of children and mothers took place. This was the 
            last evacuation of the war. Most evacuees were able to return home 
            during 1945. Some, though, were orphans, because their parents had 
            been killed in air raids.</p>
