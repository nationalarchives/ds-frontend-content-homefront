              As the prospect of war became increasingly likely, the government 
              wanted to increase the amount of food grown within Britain. This 
              would mean that less food would have to be imported freeing up more 
              ships for troop movements and reducing the risk of convoys being 
              attacked. In order to grow more food, more help was needed on the 
              farms and so the government started the Women's Land Army. <br>
              <br>
              The Women's Land Army was set up in June 1939 and by September it 
              had over 1,000 members. By 1941, its numbers had risen to 20,000 
              and, at its peak in 1943, over 80,000 women classed themselves as 
              'Land Girls'. Numbers did not rise after that, as women were needed 
              to make aircraft and were encouraged to take up factory work instead.<br>
              <br>
              Women joined the Land Army from all backgrounds, a third coming 
              from London and other large cities. Farm work was hard, and the 
              women did all sorts of jobs including hoeing, ploughing, hedging, 
              turning hay, lifting potatoes, threshing, lambing and looking after 
              poultry. A thousand women were employed as rat catchers. Six thousand 
              women worked in the Timber Corps, felling trees and running sawmills. 
              About a quarter were employed in milking and general farm work.<br>
              <br>
              The Women's Land Army had a uniform - green jerseys, brown breeches, 
              brown felt hats and khaki overcoats. However, the Land Army was 
              not a military force and many women did not wear the uniform. Some 
              women lived in hostels but most lived on individual farms. Conditions 
              were often poor and pay was low but many women enjoyed the work. 
              The Women's Land Army remained in existence until 1950. </p>
