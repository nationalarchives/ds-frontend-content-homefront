              Although women had worked in factories before, there was a big increase 
              after war broke out in 1939. As men were called-up to join the Armed 
              Forces more and more women were needed to replace them. Women could 
              not do the heaviest lifting jobs that still needed the greater physical 
              strength of men and they were not sent to work in the mines but 
              they soon proved that they could do almost any job usually undertaken 
              by a man, and do it as well, if not better. <br>
              <br>
              Women did all kinds of work. Over half the workforce in the chemical 
              and explosive industry was made up of women; 1 ½ million worked 
              in the engineering and metal industries. Women made shells and bombs, 
              electrical cable and wire, uniforms, clothing, barrage balloons, 
              tents, parachutes and flying suits. Many became skilled welders. 
              Others played a crucial role in aircraft production. Altogether, 
              about 7 million women were employed in the war effort.<br>
              <br>
              Many women had never worked before and had to learn to cope with 
              very long working hours and night shifts. Some had to make long 
              journeys to and from work. Others had to work part-time so they 
              could look after their children. The work could also be dangerous. 
              As well as the risk of enemy bombing raids upon factories, accidents 
              were common, especially in the explosive industry. Another problem 
              women had to face was the attitude of other workers and the employers. 
              Many men did not like working with women and most women were paid 
              less than men - often only half - for doing the same work. </p>
