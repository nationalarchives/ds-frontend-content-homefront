<span class="s_body"><span class="s_titles">INSTRUCTIONS:</span> <br>
<b>(a) Principle Assignment.</b> <br>
<br>
The principle purpose of RICHTER's mission was to deliver funds and a spare wireless 
crystal to another German agent in this country whom he was instructed to contact. 
An elaborate procedure had been arranged whereby RICHTER was to identify this 
agent and, if the initial rendevous miscarried, a series of alternatives were 
arranged. RICHTER also states that he was intended to discover whether this agent 
was under control and whether the messages he was sending were authentic. <br>
<br>
<b>(b) Code: </b><br>
<br>
RICHTER was given a code which in the absence of directions for constant variation 
would have been reasonably easy to break. There is no evidence that he had any 
system for varying the code. <br>
<br>
<b>(c) Money:</b> <br>
<br>
The Germans are apparently troubled at the possibility that we may change the 
numbers or colours of the current £1 and £10 notes. They consequently provided 
RICHTER with $1,400 with instructions that he was to bury the dollar notes near 
the place where he landed. If he had difficulty in changing the English notes 
he was to retrieve the dollars and change them in small amounts at the ports, 
but not to attempt to change them in large cities or banks. <br>
<br>
<b>(d) Secret Ink:</b> <br>
<br>
RICHTER was instructed in the use of _______tablets dissolved in alcohol for the 
purpose of secret writing. He did not bring any__________tablets with him, but 
said that he had been told to purchase an article sold in England under the name 
of __________which would dissolve in water and provide a secret ink. He was given 
detailed instructions has to how to write his messages, and was supplied with 
a cover address in Sweden to which he could send letters if in difficulty.__________ 
is in fact __________and is apparently obtainable at any chemist's shop on signing 
the poison book. It is the equivalent of . <br>
<br>
<b>(e) Questionnaire: </b><br>
<br>
RICHTER was instructed to give information on the following points in his first 
investigations:- <br>
<br>
(i) What was the road like, or what were roads in general like - under strict, 
or not strict control? <br>
(ii) What was the control at the railway station like? <br>
(iii) Was it necessary to show one's Identity Card? <br>
(iv) Is it necessary to show this card when spending a night at an hotel? <br>
(v) Are gas masks carried in England, and how? <br>
(vi) Are they carried generally or only on journeys? He was expected to send written 
reports as frequently as possible and also information on the general conditions 
in the district in which he found himself.</span>
