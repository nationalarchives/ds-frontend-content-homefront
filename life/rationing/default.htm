              After war was declared in September 1939, the British government 
              had to cut down on the amount of food it brought in from abroad 
              as German submarines started bombing British supply ships. There 
              was a worry that this would lead to shortages of food supplies in 
              the shops and very high prices for what was left, making it very 
              difficult for a lot of people to get enough to eat.</p>
            <p>Rationing of food was introduced in January 1940. Everybody was 
              issued with a ration book. This contained coupons that had to be 
              handed in to the shops every time rationed food was bought. As well 
              as the basic ration everybody had 16 coupons each month that they 
              could spend on what they wished.</p>
            <p>This made sure that everyone was able to buy and eat the basic 
              food necessary to keep them fit and healthy. Bacon, butter and sugar 
              were among the first things to be rationed. Some foods such as potatoes, 
              fruit and fish were not rationed. People were able to buy these 
              things, provided they could afford them and there were supplies 
              in the shops.</p>
            <p>The government tried to encourage people to grow their own food 
              at home. The 'Dig for Victory' campaign, started in October 1939, 
              was one of the most famous of the war. It encouraged people to use 
              every spare piece of land, including their gardens, to grow vegetables.</p>
